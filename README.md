# Raytracer
This is being made by thankfully following the teachings in [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

I intend to make this project have its own personality with some 90s/dreamcore/frutiger aero graphics.

And... implement this in the Pixel Game Engine!
