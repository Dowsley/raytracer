# Raytracer
This is being made by thankfully following the teachings in [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

I intend to make this project have its own personality with some 90s/dreamcore/frutiger aero graphics.

# TODOs:
- [X] Implement core classes
- [X] Add PPM image output
- [ ] Cast the first rays
